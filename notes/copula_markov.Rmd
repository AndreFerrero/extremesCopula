Copulas have been used to model univariate time series by constructing Markov models.

For example, a copula-based markov model of order one assumes:

\[ (Y_t, Y_{t+1}) \sim C(F(y_t), F(y_{t+1})) ,\]

with $F$ the marginal distribution.

This approach differs from defining a copula over the entire sequence $Y_1, \dots , Y_n$ and offers the computational advantage
of using bivariate copulas, characterised by a likelihood simpler to evaluate.
