# 2025

## November 2025

### Meeting 06/11/2025
**Attendees:** Andrea, Gwladys, Nicolas, Klaus  
**Time:** 14:30 - 15:45  

**Topics:** Review of the main paper ideas, proposal of some directions, suggestion of literature  

**Description:**  
- The first idea is to perform estimation on the copula parameters (parametric approach given a specific copula choice, e.g., Archimedean), after which estimation of the limiting distribution of the maxima should arise as a consequence of G = D o H.  
- Nonparametric approaches are to be considered future work.

**Main concern:**  
- Estimation of H via standard methods might fail with dependent sequences violating the D(u_n) condition.

**To-do:**  
- Review Bayesian methodology for extremes, focusing on extremal index  
- Review Archimedean copulas and their connection with exchangeable sequences  
- Simulation studies to explore dependence in block maxima and inspect sensitivity of parameter estimation under strong dependence

**Literature:**  
- *Statistics of Extremes* by Berlaint et al.  
- *Handbook on Statistics of Extremes* by de Carvalho et al.  
- *Heavy tailed time series* by Soulier and Kulik

### Meeting 17/11/2025
**Attendees:** Andrea, Gwladys, Nicolas  
**Time:** 16:00 - 17:30  

**Topics:** Copula estimation with univariate data, proposal of some directions  

**Description:**  
- Estimation of copulas with a univariate sequence requires ad hoc tools; the `copula` package expects n × d structure (observations × dimension).  
- Likelihood: `l() = log c(u1, ..., un)` with `c` the density of the copula.  
- High-dimensional issues arise: evaluating density at `d > 220` fails with current functions.  

**Proposed Approaches:**  
1. Assume a Markov property and model pairs with bivariate copulas.  
2. Use blocks of data (K × n_k) to estimate copula parameters with MLE.  
3. Consider vine copulas.  

**Methods:** Pairwise composite likelihood was mentioned as a potential estimation tool.

## December 2025

### Meeting 01/12/2025
**Attendees:** Andrea, Klaus, Nicolas  
**Time:** 16:00 - 17:30  

**Topics:**  
- Gumbel distortion on GEV parameters  
- Sampling and identifiability problems in the joint copula model  
- Possible direction on the copula-based Markov model  

**Description:**  
- Simulation shows Gumbel copula shape parameter is unaffected, but location and scale are distorted.  
- Proposal: inspect distribution of B maxima and compare to theoretical results.  
- Discussed copula-based Markov model: ergodicity, estimation of extremal index, Bayesian uncertainty propagation.

# 2026

## January 2026

### Meeting 12/01/2026
**Attendees:** Andrea, Nicolas, Gwladys  
**Time:** 16:00 - 17:30  

**Topics:** Recap, fixing ideas and doubts on current and potential approaches, showing current results  

**Description:**  
- Likelihood intractability in high dimensions (n > 220 for Gumbel copula) motivates **Simulation-Based Inference**, specifically **Semiparametric Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood**.  
- Sample from the model, summarize with informative statistics, approximate posterior from distribution of sampled statistics.  
- Metropolis-Hastings step uses this synthetic posterior for acceptance ratio.  
- Adaptive MCMC methods improve sampler efficiency (proposal covariance adaptation, targeting acceptance rate ~0.234).  
- Fully parametric model (lognormal F, Gumbel copula θ) gives results on maxima distribution.
