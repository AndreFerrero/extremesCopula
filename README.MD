# Extreme Value Modelling using Copulas

This PhD repo contains code, notes and simulations for my research topic.

The main goal is to model extreme values in a univariate dependent setting. This is done using copulas and leveraging theoretical connections to estimate the limit distribution of the maxima. Most of the proposals involve a Bayesian approach.
